# Overview:
The demand for cloud services is growing, and with it, so are the associated security risks. In order to address this, we are developing a system that will offer an architecture to securely encrypt your data prior to storing and outsourcing it to unreliable cloud platforms. This would lessen the security risks and attack surfaces in the cloud, such as PII leakage, inadequate authentication, and authorization, access management risks, and other security risks.
This system is a user-side encrypted file system for shared and stored external data. We shall use a hybrid identity-based encryption scheme structure based on contemporary cryptographic methods in this file system. Additionally, this file system was created to safeguard the integrity of outsourced information from data theft and deletion attempts.
